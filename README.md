# Tweets Analysis

The purpose of this task is to determine whether a given tweet containing "apple" is referring to the company Apple Inc. or not (whether it's referring to the fruit) using machine learning.

A feature vector is built containing the important words in the tweet, and three different classification algorithms are tried (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM) for optimum results. Training data is obtained from the Twitter Streaming API and the tweets are manually labeled.
